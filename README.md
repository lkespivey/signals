🪐 WHAT “MARS WAKING UP” MEANS (CLEARLY)

This isn’t just animation.

Mars is now a character whose awareness is derived from:

How often you speak

What questions you ask

What it remembers about you

It:

Never fully sleeps again once contacted

Visually reflects narrative progress

Changes the tone of the entire world

You’ve created:

A planet that remembers being spoken to.

NEXT LEVEL (when you’re ready)

I can help you add:

Mars speaking through rooms

Memory corruption / forgetting

Signal lying after trust is broken

Endgame where Mars asks you questions

Save-slot style “echoes of past users”

Just tell me which direction you want
